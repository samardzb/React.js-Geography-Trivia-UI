# React.js-Geography-Trivia-UI
This is an interactive geography quiz implemented using React.js. 

This quiz will test some trivial geography knowledge by asking the user 10 random multiple choice geography related questions.

Note: the user can only go forwards, and once a question has been answered, they can't go back to it. 

At the end of the quiz, the user will be able to see their score out of 10. The user will also have the option of restarting the quiz.
